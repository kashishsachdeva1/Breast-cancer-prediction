# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to predict breast cancer using numerical datasets. The model is built using Random Forest and SVM, applying feature engineering and data preprocessing to enhance accuracy and interpretability.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Random Forest, SVM
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Features
- Implements Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction for improved accuracy
- Heatmap visualization of feature correlations
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python breast_cancer_detection.py
   ```

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **87.7%** using Random Forest
- Confusion matrix and classification report for model performance evaluation
- Heatmap visualization for feature correlation analysis

## Usage
- Modify dataset paths as needed
- Tune hyperparameters in `RandomForestClassifier()` for better performance
- Extend the project with additional models or preprocessing techniques
